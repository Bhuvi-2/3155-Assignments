This program helps make a sandwich. It uses multiple methods to do this. The first method is the check_resources method, which checks if there are enough ingredients left to make the sandwhich.
The second method is the process_coins method, which helps processes the coins the user inserts to pay for the sandwich. It accepts nickels, quarters, half dollars, and dollars.
The third method is the transaction_results method, which makes sure the amount of coins inserted is enough to pay for the sandwich. If the user pays extra, it provides change as well.
The fourth method is the make_sandwich method, which actually makes the sandwich and deducts the ingredients used.
After this, we have our main code to actually run these methods.
It asks the user whether they want to order a small, medium, or large sandwich, or if they want to generate a report or turn off the machine.
It then processes each result accordingly by plugging the user selection into the methods I made.
